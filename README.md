## Introduction

This is the repository of Atari skiing with deep reinforcement learning. We will try to optimize on deep Q learning, double DQN and dueling DQN. The following are some initial proposals.

- Import expert replay data from heuristic agent. The agent will always direct the player to the mid place between the flags (checkpoints).
- Distribute penalty of uncrossed checkpoints to previous rewards
- Hyper-parameter tuning: learning rate decay, epsilon decay, etc.
